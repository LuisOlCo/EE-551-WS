Study of the generation of renewable energies in Europe and how it correlates with GDP

The main goal of this project was to study which percentage of the total energy produced by the European countries corresponds to the production of RE (renewable energy) and how the production of RE is correlated with the GDP of each country within the study.  Lastly, this project established a way to predict the future RE production based on the available GDP data. For this project, data was taken from the European Commission (where it shows every country energy production), and from the International Monetary Fund, where it gives the GDP of each country on the world for every year from 1984 to 2024.

To start the project, I first designed a program that displays a graph where it shows the percentage produced of RE of all countries under study for a determined year (program: ranking_year_every_country.py). Therefore, by typing in the year we can get every percentage of each country. This allow us to have an idea of how good/bad the countries are doing related to this issue for a certain year.

Secondly, I established the relationship between the GDP and the production of RE for each specific country (program: GDP_renewables.py). In the graph generated by the program, there is not a clear relationship between the GDP and the percentage of RE produced at first glance.  However it is reasonable to say that there will be a delay between the time  that a country decides to invest money on green energy and the time that these technologies will be ready to produce energy. This  was why I applied a cross correlation between the growth of the GDP and the growth of production of RE, to see how the years the GDP was high was reflected in years after in the form of increased of RE production. At the end of this program (after displaying the three graphs), the program gives a short sentence with the lag time between the GDP curve and the production of RE curve in years.

Next step, once we have computed the lag time for a determined country, we can associate the GDP growth of a certain year with the RE production growth reflected years later. Based on the lag that has been computed, it is possible to establish a relationship between GDP growth and the amount of RE growth. Program: linear_regression.py allowed me to establish a linear regression between the growth values of GDP with the growth values of RE production years after depending on the lag.  The accuracy of the equation that relates economic growth with RE production can be modified by changing the parameters iter and L. Once this equation  has been determined, it is possible to predict the production of RE for any year that we have data (this will depend on the lag). At the end of this program the production of RE can be computed for 2019 for any given country.

Finally, program country_biggest_growth.py behaves in a similar way that the previous program showed. In this case, instead of predicting the growth of one country for 2019, it computes the expected growth RE production for 2019 for every European country and it gives the country that is expected to grow the most in regards to its RE.
